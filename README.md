Three Systems That Use Servo Motors In My Environment in their workings .

1.Textiles: Servo motors control industrial spinning and weaving machines, looms, and knitting machines that produce textiles and fabrics.

2.Printing Presses/Printers: Servo motors stop and start the print heads precisely on the page as well as move paper along to print multiple rows of text or graphics in exact lines, whether it's a newspaper, a magazine, or an annual report.Within printing press applications, servo motors are often selected for their high accuracy and speed.

3.Automatic Door Openers: Supermarkets and hospital entrances that are automated are controlled by servo motors.They push signalsvia push plate beside the door for handicapped access or by radio a  transmitter positioned overhead.
