# Servo-Motors
Three Systems That Use Servo Motors In My Environment in their workings .

1.Textiles: Servo motors control industrial spinning and weaving machines, looms, and knitting machines that produce textiles such as carpeting and fabrics as well as wearable items such as socks, caps, gloves, and mittens.
2.Printing Presses/Printers: Servo motors stop and start the print heads precisely on the page as well as move paper along to print multiple rows of text or graphics in exact lines, whether it's a newspaper, a magazine, or an annual report
3.Automatic Door Openers: Supermarkets and hospital entrances are prime examples of automated door openers controlled by servo motors, whether the signal to open is via push plate beside the door for handicapped access or by radio transmitter positioned overhead.
